# DDOD-Leads

The [Issues section](https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/DDOD-Leads/issues) of this "DDOD Leads" repo tracks subjects presented to the DDOD team.  Basically, this is a queue of topics that don't have enough specificity yet to be entered as use cases.  Items here may eventually become DDOD use cases (in ["DDOD Intake" repo](https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-Intake/issues)).  

Within the context of the diagram below, **"Leads"** could be **"Concepts"**, **"Challenges"** or **"Standards"**.  Ultimately all of these feed into achievable and measurable **"Use Cases"** to be fulfilled.

The goals of the repo:
 * Make sure the DDOD team doesn't drop potential future use cases
 * Continue to collect specifications for these leads, such that they can become use cases
